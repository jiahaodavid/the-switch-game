<p>Switch game rules</p>
<p>4-person rule</p>
<p>Ready to work
52 cards (no size king) &amp; 4 different pieces</p>
<p>Each player draws a card, the smallest one is Zhuang</p>
<p>If there is a minimum at the same time, the few people who draw the tie will draw again until the smallest one appears.</p>
<p>Note: A maximum</p>
<p>After shuffling, the dealer draws 36 cards and arranges them in 6*6. The cards face up.</p>
<p>Each player's piece is placed on the leftmost card in the first row in front of them.</p>
<p>Moving rule</p>
<p>The first step starts with the player on the left side of the dealer and goes to the left wheel (clockwise)</p>
<p>The player can move any number of cells in the row or column he is in.</p>
<p>Can't move diagonally</p>
<p>Can't cross or stay on the grid of other players</p>
<p>When the player’s piece stays on a card, the card belongs to the player.</p>
<p>Player's cards will be placed face up in front of you</p>
<p>Even if the card has been taken, the 6*6 format still exists and the player can stay in the space.</p>
<p>When the player stays in the space, the player does not get any cards.</p>
<p>Each player must move at least one space per round</p>
<p>Unless the player is blocked by another player, the opportunity to move this round is lost.</p>
<p>Each player can't stay in place in the first round to get the cards on the ground.</p>
<p>Special circumstances: When the dealer is blocked by other players in the first round, he can take the cards on his place.</p>
<p>Alliance/competition rules</p>
<p>Player A can move between player B and the card he wants to get, blocking player B to take the card (or player A takes the
card directly)</p>
<p>Players can announce an alliance with another player before it is his turn to move.</p>
<p>Players selected as allies of the player may not refuse</p>
<p>The other two players also automatically become alliances.</p>
<p>There is only one chance to announce the league in each game (a game, it should play at least three innings)</p>
<p>After the league, teammates still need to take cards for themselves (the cards of the two are not combined)</p>
<p>The main strategy of cooperation is</p>
<p>Help teammates block the enemy and let teammates take cards</p>
<p>Be the first to take off the cards the enemy wants</p>
<p>End authority</p>
<p>In theory, when all cards are taken away by the player, or blocked, no one can get it, the game is over.</p>
<p>In fact, players can stop the authorities if they find they are in an unstoppable position</p>
<p>Players can choose to end this game early if they find that they are in an unmatchable situation.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the player who made the highest card (5 cards)</p>
<p>If you tie, no one scores → will play another game</p>
<p>After a game is in good condition, after the card is shuffled, draw the cards again.</p>
<p>Scoring rules</p>
<p>Players should try to make a high-profile</p>
<p>The following cards are from top to bottom, and the scores are from high to low.</p>
<p>Straight flush</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Three belt two</p>
<p>same color</p>
<p>Straight</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Double pair</p>
<p>Pair</p>
<p>Straight Flush and Straight score the highest score</p>
<p>Four, three and pair of high scores in the largest card in the combination</p>
<p>Three bands and two with three of the biggest cards to score high points</p>
<p>The same flower and double pair score the highest score</p>
<p>If the biggest card is the same, then compare the second largest card</p>
<p>If the values are the same, then the tie</p>
<p>Flowers are not included in the score, all colors are equal</p>
<p>A is always the biggest, except in the straight A-2-3-4-5</p>
<p>Score per game</p>
<p>A chooses B as a teammate</p>
<p>If B wins, B gets 7 points and A gets 3 points.</p>
<p>If A wins, neither of them will score.</p>
<p>Hostile C wins, C gets 6 points, and his teammate D gets 4 points.</p>
<p>If the AB surrenders in advance, the current cards of C and D will be calculated, with 6 points for the high score and 4</p>
<p>points for the other.</p>
<p>If the CD surrenders in advance, B gets 7 points and A gets 3 points.</p>
<p>If no one chooses the league in this game, the player who wins will get 10 points.</p>
<p>Whole game scoring rules</p>
<p>When the player has 16 points or more, he has the ability to move his own and his teammate's pieces.</p>
<p>The player can choose to move his or his teammate's pieces in each round, and the cards obtained are owned by the player.</p>
<p>If both teammates have more than 16 points, then they have no power to use this special ability.</p>
<p>The winner of 20 points is the winner of this game</p>
<p>When the two scored 20 points or more after the end of the same game, the highest scorer is the winner of the game.</p>
<p>If it is even, then play another game.</p>
<p>Note: After playing another game, it is possible that another player gets a high score and gets the highest score in the game.</p>
<p>2-person rule</p>
<p>25 cards in 5*5</p>
<p>Two players face each other, and the pieces are placed on the leftmost card in the first row in front of them.</p>
<p>10 points for each player with the highest card number</p>
<p>40 points for the winner of this game</p></article>
